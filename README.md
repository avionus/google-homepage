Hello!

This is the very first project I'm doing for the Odin Project where I'm learning to be a web developer. By the end of this project, I should have a semi-functioning (mostly clickable) verison of the Google Homepage made entirely of HTML and CSS. If I feel comfortable, I may even do the results page, but we'll see when I get there.
